### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Oliver, a Software and Cloud Architect working in the financial industry.

One of my favorite stacks is TypeScript in combination with Rust/WASM in the frontend and in the backend (with Node).

My other love is Go, as well as Docker and Kubernetes. I'm hugely in favor of containerization and DevOps / Site Reliability Engineering.
